## Process:

I decided to do a website for Mr. Chris

I first talked to him on January 20th in person, and I showed him my layout. he told me that he was looking for a good website that shows what the UI Elements are and what they do. There wasn't any feedback.

This was my layout at the beginning

![my markup for the website layout](media/Layout.png)

it had a title/hero, 3 cards with info, a sidebar with links, and text.

This was based on my taco truck webpage, which had a similar layout.

When I started developing, I copied the style.css and index.html from my taco truck webpage. I then added links to the sidebar that were nested in lists. I cleaned up some of the styling, fiddled with sticky positions, and added the .js validator. I then realized that the cards that were in my previous layout don't really have a purpose, so I removed them. I then changed the background colors, and started work on the other pages.  
I created two folders inside my project, inputs and buttons. Inside the folders were all the files of those categories. I added a new grid in style.css, put it in the ther files, added placeholder text and a back button and I was finished.

I talked to him on Febuary 3rd in person, and showed him the progress. He was happy with the way it was going and had no feedback.

I then added pictures in the media folder and started work on this file.
