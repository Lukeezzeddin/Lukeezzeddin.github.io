		<p>I've selected this recipe because it's been in my family for
		a long time. There's been so many times where I come home from
		school and my mom has baked me some wood chips before I head off
		to football. As my mom always says, <q>If you eat wood, you
		be good</q></p> 
		<h2>Tips, Tricks, and Substitutions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you don't have an Oak tree, Hickory or Maple also
				taste good</li>
		<li>You want to make your wood in a wet, sunny
			room to let it grow better</li>
		</ul>
