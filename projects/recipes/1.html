		<p>I've selected this recipe because it's been in my family for a long time. There's been so many times where I come home from school and my mom has baked me some charcoal before I head off to football. As my mom always says, <q>If you eat charcoal, you be barcoal</q></p> 
		<h2>Tips, Tricks, and Substitutions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you don't have Oak wood, Hickory or Maple also taste good</li>
		<li>You want to make your charcoal in a dry, well ventilated room to make it burn more easily</li>
		</ul>
