# The TCP/IP Model

## Aplication

Application works with you, it finds what data you want to send, converts it to binary, and sends it to the transport layer. it also takes binary from the transport layer and turns it back into what it was.

Some Branches Include

- World Wide Web (all websites)

- SMS (simple messaging system)

- Email

## Transport

Transport "sets it up" for application. It checks to see if all the packets are in the right order, and if all of the packets are there and if any information in the packets is missing. When sending information, it breaks the information into packets

Some branches are:

- TCP
- UDP

## Internet

This layer is responsible for getting your information to the right spot. It deals with routers and net traffic and all that stuff

Some branches are:

- Routing
- IP

## Link

Link is what connects your computer to a router so you can receive information

Protocols in this layer include:

- Wifi
- Ethernet
- LTE
- Bluetooth
