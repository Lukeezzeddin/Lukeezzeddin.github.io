		<h3>Inro:</h3>
		<p>Vim is an incredible tool for editing text that is already installed on your computer!<br>In this website, I will be showing you the basics of Vim to get you started. Be warned, I will be somewhat accurate and even less thorough!<br>To start out, lets make a file called vimpractice.html. the command for that is<br><code>touch vimpractice.html</code><br>Now, to get into vim,  we'll run <br><code>vim vimpractice.html</code><br> (we could've just run vim vimpractice.html from the beginning and it would've created it for us but this is just practice)</p>
		<h3>How Vim Works</h3>
		<p>Now you're in Vim! Right now you'll see a blank document. right now you're in command mode, so let's press <kbd>i</kbd> to get into insert mode. you should see<samp> -- INSERT -- </samp>in the bottom left of your screen. in insert mode you can move around with the arrow keys (not with your cursor; this was invented before cursors), and type letters into your document. Now press <kbd>esc</kbd> to go back into command mode. here are the most useful comands:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>x</dt>
			<dd>removes the letter you're currently on</dd>
			<dt>dd</dt>
			<dd>removes the line you're currently on</dd>
